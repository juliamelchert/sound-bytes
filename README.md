This interactive application allows users to input a musician's name and a song by them and receive the musician's biography and the song's lyrics (if applicable). It utilizes the **microservices architecture** to pull together the UI, lyric scraping microservice, and Wikipedia scraping microservice. Additionally, the UI was created using **PyQt** and **Qt Designer** and the Wikipedia scraping microservice was created using **BeautifulSoup** and the **Wikipedia API**. More information on the Wikipedia scraper microservice can be found *[here](https://github.com/melcherj22/wikipedia-scraper-microservice).*

This was the final assignment for CS 361 (Software Engineering I) at Oregon State University in March 2022.

Please view the *[video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD8yrElzSCA)* to see this application in action.
